We employ a varied collection of five separate machine learning models to perform predictive analyses on a historical dataset concerning rainfall, minimum, and maximum temperatures. These models are distinguished by their individual methodologies, each possessing unique strengths and capabilities. Our strategy involves integrating regression algorithms, thereby encompassing a comprehensive range of techniques to effectively tackle the complexities associated with this multifaceted task. Moreover we also used averaging technique i.e Ensebled of all for effectively handling all complexities.
