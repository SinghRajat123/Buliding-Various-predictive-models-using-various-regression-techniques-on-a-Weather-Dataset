We employ a varied collection of five separate machine learning models with Ensembled of all to perform predictive analyses on a historical dataset concerning rainfall, minimum, and maximum temperatures.  Our strategy involves integrating regression algorithms, thereby encompassing a comprehensive range of techniques to effectively tackle the complexities associated with this multifaceted task. Moreover we also used averaging technique i.e Ensebled of all for effectively handling all complexities.
